# Current Task: Core Agent Development and Workflow Integration

## Current Objectives
1. Develop core agents: RepoLoaderAgent, FileClassifierAgent, SnippetExtractorAgent, ResultWriterAgent
2. Design and implement multi-agent workflow orchestration using LangGraph
3. Implement robust state management and error handling
4. Begin prompt engineering for snippet extraction quality improvement

## Context
Building intelligent LLM-based agents to automate the discovery, analysis, and extraction of algorithmic trading strategies from GitHub repositories. This task is central to the AgentForge projectâ€™s goal of creating a modular, scalable agent system.

## Next Steps
1. Complete development of core agents
2. Integrate agents into a LangGraph workflow
3. Test workflow with sample repositories
4. Iterate on prompt design and extraction accuracy

## Related Tasks from Roadmap
- Develop core agent pipeline
- Implement workflow orchestration
- Enhance snippet extraction prompts

## Technical Requirements
- LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- Pydantic for typed state management
- LLM API integration (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT)
- GitPython for repository cloning

## Progress Notes
- Architectural decisions finalized
- Initial scaffolding and repo loader agent implemented
