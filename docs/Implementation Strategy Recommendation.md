Based on where your project stands and the roadmap we've developed, I recommend focusing on creating a **minimal working scaffolding with core agent logic first**, rather than trying to implement everything at once.

Here's my recommended approach:

## 1. Start with Core Scaffolding (First Priority)

Focus on getting the basic structure and workflow operational with minimal but functional implementations:

1. **Set up the project structure** from the scaffold provided
2. **Implement the state model** (`WorkflowState` class)
3. **Create simple versions of the essential agents**:
    - `RepoLoaderAgent` - just clone repos
    - `FileClassifierAgent` - simple rule-based Python file identification
    - `SnippetExtractorAgent` - basic extraction with a well-crafted prompt

This will give you a functional pipeline that actually produces results, even if they're rough.

## 2. Focus on Prompt Engineering for the Extractor (Second Priority)

The quality of your extracted snippets will heavily depend on prompt quality. Create a few specific prompt templates for:

- Strategy classification (trend following vs mean reversion vs breakout)
- Function extraction with proper context
- Dependency identification

Spend time iterating on these prompts with a few sample repositories before building out the full system.

## 3. Create a Simple Result Viewer (Third Priority)

Being able to browse and inspect extracted snippets will help you quickly evaluate system effectiveness. A basic HTML page that shows:

- Extracted code with syntax highlighting
- Metadata about the snippet (type, source, confidence)
- Ability to filter/sort by strategy type

## 4. Defer These Features Until Later

- The ML evaluation layer
- Plugin architecture
- Feedback collection system
- Comprehensive UI

## Implementation Sample: Core Working System

Here's what I recommend implementing first:

```python
# main.py - A simple executable workflow

import asyncio
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import argparse
import os
from pathlib import Path

from models.state import WorkflowState
from agents.repo_loader import RepoLoaderAgent
from agents.file_classifier import FileClassifierAgent
from agents.snippet_extractor import SnippetExtractorAgent
from agents.result_writer import ResultWriterAgent

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Extract trading strategies from GitHub repos")
    parser.add_argument("--repos", nargs="+", required=True, help="GitHub repository URLs")
    parser.add_argument("--output", default="./extracted_snippets", help="Output directory")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Create output directory
    os.makedirs(args.output, exist_ok=True)

    # Initialize state
    state = WorkflowState(
        repo_urls=args.repos,
        output_path=args.output
    )

    # Initialize agents with basic config
    repo_loader = RepoLoaderAgent({"max_retries": 3})
    file_classifier = FileClassifierAgent({"min_score": 0.6})
    snippet_extractor = SnippetExtractorAgent({"model": os.getenv("LLM_MODEL", "claude-3-opus-20240229")})
    result_writer = ResultWriterAgent({"formats": ["json", "py"]})

    # Execute workflow manually for now (before adding LangGraph)
    logger.info("Starting workflow")

    # Step 1: Load repositories
    state = await repo_loader.process(state)
    if state.errors:
        logger.error(f"Errors during repo loading: {state.errors}")
        if not state.repo_paths:
            logger.error("No repositories loaded, exiting")
            return

    # Step 2: Classify files
    state = await file_classifier.process(state)
    if not state.classified_files:
        logger.warning("No relevant files found, exiting")
        return

    # Step 3: Extract snippets
    state = await snippet_extractor.process(state)
    if not state.snippets:
        logger.warning("No snippets extracted, exiting")
        return

    # Step 4: Write results
    state = await result_writer.process(state)

    logger.info(f"Workflow completed. Extracted {len(state.snippets)} snippets to {args.output}")

    # Print snippet summary
    print("\nExtracted Snippets Summary:")
    for snippet_id, snippet in state.snippets.items():
        print(f"- {snippet.snippet_type}/{snippet.subtype}: {snippet_id} (confidence: {snippet.confidence_score:.2f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This minimal implementation will:

1. Clone repositories
2. Identify potentially useful Python files
3. Extract code snippets
4. Save them to disk in a structured format

Once this is working, you can incrementally add LangGraph for proper workflow orchestration.

## Why This Approach?

1. **Get Immediate Feedback**: You'll quickly see how well the LLM extracts code snippets before investing in complex workflow orchestration
2. **Iterative Development**: You can improve the core extraction logic before adding advanced features
3. **Maintain Motivation**: Seeing actual extracted snippets early will keep you motivated to enhance the system

Are you interested in this sequential approach? Or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect first?
