# GitHub Projects Automation for AgentForge

## Why We Are Doing This

Keeping track of project status, progress, and next steps manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Updates to roadmaps and status documents often lag behind actual development activity, causing confusion and inefficiency.

By leveraging GitHub Projects (Beta) and GitHub Actions automation, we aim to:

- Automate status tracking directly linked to GitHub issues, pull requests, and commits
- Maintain a live, interactive project board that reflects real-time progress
- Reduce manual overhead in updating documentation and roadmaps
- Improve visibility and collaboration within the team
- Ensure consistent and structured project management aligned with development workflows

## What We Are Doing

- Setting up a GitHub Projects board tailored to AgentForgeâ€™s workflow and goals
- Defining issue and pull request templates to standardize task reporting
- Creating GitHub Actions workflows that automatically update project board cards and status files based on commit messages, PR merges, and issue events
- Establishing commit message conventions to trigger automation
- Documenting the process for maintaining and extending the automation

## How to Continue and Maintain

- Use the provided issue and PR templates for all new tasks and changes
- Follow the commit message conventions to ensure automation triggers correctly
- Monitor the GitHub Projects board for real-time status updates
- Update GitHub Actions workflows as needed to accommodate new automation requirements
- Regularly review and refine templates and automation scripts to improve accuracy and coverage
- Document any changes to the automation setup in this folder

This setup will evolve as the project grows, so maintaining clear documentation and consistent practices is essential for long-term success.
